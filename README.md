# hello-world
I want to be a coder and a programmer of the future.
I will start learning front end and learn python and alot more.
I will continue to learn and always be a better and faster programmer then what i was the day before.

I Wonder what is the most efficient way to be relevent?I guess by working on whats today's problems.
